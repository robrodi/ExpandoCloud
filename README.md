# ExpandoCloud
ExpandoCloud is a storage prototype for connecting to azure table storage directly via rest and returning dynamic objects.

### Goal
The idea is that this will allow a developer to query a table for entities of different schemas with the same partition key and easily retrieve the results in a single request.

### Features
Currently, ExpandoCloud only retrieves data.
